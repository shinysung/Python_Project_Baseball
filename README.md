Project name : Number Baseball

Description:

The computer randomly selects three different numbers between 0 and 9. 

For example, the computer might pick 5, 2, and 3, or it could pick 6, 7, and 4. 

The user must input three numbers and try to match both the values and positions of the numbers picked by the computer.

The computer provides feedback based on the following rules: 

if a number's value and position both match, it's called a 'strike' (S), 

and if only the value matches but the position doesn't, it's called a 'ball' (B). 

For example, if the computer picks 1, 2, and 3, and the user inputs 1, 3, and 5, 

the feedback would be 1S (one number's value and position match) and 

1B (the value of one number matches but not the position).

There's no limit to the number of attempts, but the number of attempts will be recorded. 

The game ends when the user correctly guesses all three numbers' values and positions, indicated by 3S.
